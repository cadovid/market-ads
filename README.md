# Statistical analysis of the best markets to advertise in

In this project a statistical analysis is provided over the data from [freeCodeCamp's 2017 New Coder Survey](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/we-asked-20-000-people-who-they-are-and-how-theyre-learning-to-code-fff5d668969/). The site `freeCodeCamp` is a free e-learning platform that offers courses on web development. The goals are to identify the best country markets to advertise in for a new e-learning platform using Python.
